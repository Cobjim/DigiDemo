GPIO.cleanup() # Clean up




#THINGS TO KNOW AND WORK ON
#1. The program doesnt close the loop
#2. The program is not currently reading a second user in its interation this maybe a problem within the loop and where to place the identifier() function
#3. The algorithm is monitoring how much time there is water coming out of the tanks but it is always equal to the time.sleep in the startpump function


###################################################
# NEXT STEPS
#  Include the STOP button function
#  Find a better place to call the identifier funtion
#  Create the variables to safe the amount of liquids stored
#  Measure the Volumen of liquid give in function of the time.
#  Include an alarm that will sum up how much liquids has each user drank in that day
